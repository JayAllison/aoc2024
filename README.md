# Introduction 
This is the project for sharing puzzle solutions to Advent of Code (AoC) 2024.

# Getting Started
1.	Create a branch using your name (ie: JayAllison)
2.	Commit your solutions to that branch
3.	Don't merge your solutions to any other branch
4.  Join the Atrius or Distech leaderboard!

# Organizing Your Puzzle Solutions

AoC consists of two puzzles per day for 25 days. Each day you will also have sample data along with the full puzzle data.

How do you plan to organize your files - by name or by folder? Just something to think about as you get started within your branch.
